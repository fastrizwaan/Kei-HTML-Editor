Pure Javascript HTML Editor Ready to Drop Into Your Web Pages

Small, but remarkably powerful, this stand-alone word processor was designed to be dropped into web pages with a minimum of effort.

Lots of good folks have written simple editors that take advantage of the JavaScript execCommand to compose and format HTML documents. This project goes well beyond the capabilities of these other tools by using specialized JavaScript functions to create richly styled CSS documents with Tables and lots of other elements. All of which was implemented in less than a total of 1,500 lines of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code.

And undo/redo works with everything.

Improvements to the code base are welcome and encouraged.
